## Linear Regression
### Project Description:
The Stock Market has always been a prime target for predictive analysis. With each passing day, fortunes rise and fall according to the price of each stock. Here, I wanted to determine if there was a relation between the **closing price** - the most recent valuation of a security until the next working day - and that day's **opening price** - the price at which a security first trades upon the opening of an exchange on a trading day.
